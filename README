eCGF
In silico CGF subtyping of Campylobacter using whole-genome sequence data

Getting Started

Prerequisites:
    1) All primer sequences and amplicon sequences that are being inputted into the program must be in Fasta file format
       such as the following:
            >cj0008
            CCGCTTTATCTGGATCTTGTTC
            >cj0033
            TGAAGCCAAGTAAAACCAAAAACA

    2) All forward primer sequences must be in a single Fasta file together, reverse primer sequences in a single Fasta
       file together and all amplicon sequences in a single Fasta file together.
        ie. eCGF takes in one forward primers file, one reverse primers file and one amp sequences file.
    3) All databases must be formatted using makeblastdb prior to running the program.
        a) Installing blast:
            Visit this webpage for instructions:
            https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/

        b)Formatting database(s) using makeblastdb:

           To format a single database, type the following into a terminal:
           $makeblastdb -in /path/to/database/location -dbtype nucl

           To format multiple databases in a directory, type the following into a terminal:
           $makeblastdb -in /path/to/databases/directory/*.fasta; do /path/to/makeblastdb/installation/bin/makeblastdb -in $file -dbtype nucl

How to run:
** how to run
    ** github account?

Result
 - binary gene presence/absence data

Validation Setting (Debug Option)
- decision tree --> ValTree

** how to interpret validation data?

**NOTES:

If you receive more fingerprints in the database, this is how you can add it to the program:
 --> must be the same order of genes that is in the program
